# Multi-Robot-System-
The idea is to implement an object prioritization problem.  the robot is programmed to select and pick objects from a set of available objects on the map on priority. On top of that optimize the minimum time and send the control signal to the existing MPC problem to reach desired coordinates on the map.

# Problem statement
To sort some objects, there are many methods: previously manually, and now it goes in the direction of automation. Based on different criteria, the objects are identified and classified into some sectors. In this work, the color of the objects is used to differentiate the objects. An optimization problem is formed to make Lego robots take the objects with the same color and put them in a standard predefined destination.
